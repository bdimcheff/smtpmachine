Hello,

Today we are proud to release Rack 1.0.1, a maintenance release.

= Rack, a modular Ruby webserver interface

Rack provides a minimal, modular and adaptable interface for developing
web applications in Ruby.  By wrapping HTTP requests and responses in
the simplest way possible, it unifies and distills the API for web
servers, web frameworks, and software in between (the so-called
middleware) into a single method call.

The exact details of this are described in the Rack specification,
which all Rack applications should conform to.

== Changes

* October 18th, 2009: Eighth public release 1.0.1.
  * Bump remainder of rack.versions.
  * Support the pure Ruby FCGI implementation.
  * Fix for form names containing "=": split first then unescape components
  * Fixes the handling of the filename parameter with semicolons in names.
  * Add anchor to nested params parsing regexp to prevent stack overflows
  * Use more compatible gzip write api instead of "<<".
  * Make sure that Reloader doesn't break when executed via ruby -e
  * Make sure WEBrick respects the :Host option
  * Many Ruby 1.9 fixes.

== Where can I get it?
